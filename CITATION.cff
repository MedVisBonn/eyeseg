  title: Accurate drusen segmentation in optical coherence tomography via order-constrained regression of retinal layer heights

  abstract: >-
  Drusen are an important biomarker for age-related macular
  degeneration (AMD). Their accurate segmentation based on
  optical coherence tomography (OCT) is therefore relevant
  to the detection, staging, and treatment of disease. Since
  manual OCT segmentation is resource-consuming and has low
  reproducibility, automatic techniques are required. In
  this work, we introduce a novel deep learning based
  architecture that directly predicts the position of layers
  in OCT and guarantees their correct order, achieving
  state-of-the-art results for retinal layer segmentation.
  In particular, the average absolute distance between our
  model's prediction and the ground truth layer segmentation
  in an AMD dataset is 0.63, 0.85, and 0.44 pixel for
  Bruch's membrane (BM), retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)
  and ellipsoid zone (EZ), respectively. Based on layer
  positions, we further quantify drusen load with excellent
  accuracy, achieving 0.994 and 0.988 Pearson correlation
  between drusen volumes estimated by our method and two
  human readers, and increasing the Dice score to 0.71 ±
  0.16 (from 0.60 ± 0.23) and 0.62 ± 0.23 (from 0.53 ±
  0.25), respectively, compared to a previous
  state-of-the-art method. Given its reproducible, accurate,
  and scalable results, our method can be used for the
  large-scale analysis of OCT data.
